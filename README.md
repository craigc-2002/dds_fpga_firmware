# DDS FPGA Firmware

FPGA firmware for Direct Digital Synthesis MEng final year project. 
The firmware is written in VHDL and will be synthesised for a Lattice iCE40HX8K on the Alchitry Cu development board.

Project aim is to design and build a DDS with very low phase modulation spurs in the output spectrum.
